This mod kit is designed to quickly modify a 2022 Apple TV 4K to be powered via the majority of USB Type C cables with at least 8w of power available. This can provide better power options for use when mobile, in an RV, or otherwise have better access to a USB-C port. Take your AppleTV camping with one of those mini projectors or something and skip the inverter. 

The circuit board relies on a simple setup of passive components to obtain 5v and drop it to  about 4.3v before passing it to the custom screw terminals. It includes test and injection/conversion points in case you wanted to bypass the USB-C and do your own custom conversion from a different source (eg. 12/24v). 

### Parts

The kit includes the following part

1) Custom USB-C Board to replace internal PSU
2) 3D Printed Bottom insulator
3) 3D Printed Faceplate
4) 2x Opening Picks
5) 2x M2.5x6 
6) 1x M2.0x6 (Might be able to just reuse power jack screw)


## Instructions

Use the picks to open the Apple TV

Remove 5 screws in the power supply
Remove 2 screws in the C7 jack
Remove PSU and Jack

Insert 3D Printed faceplate

Might be a good idea to pre-assemble PCB and bottom insulator with screws

From top:
VOUT: M2.5
GND: M2.5
GND: M2.0
TODO: MAKE DIAGRAM

Insert PCB assembly with usb port thru faceplate and start to thread screws, but leave loose.

Make any adjustments needed and tighten screws to hold positions.

Do not overtighten
