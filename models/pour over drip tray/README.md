## Description

I needed a place for my pour over in my bus conversion that allowed for drainage, so I made this one that sticks to the corner of the sink with VHB. Printed with PETG to reduce warpage from hot coffee.

My printer doesn't like to do tight supports like this, so I made a version in two pieces that screws together with M2 screws or similar sized thread rolling screws. You also have the singular version available and the original F3D file if you want to make modifications.
