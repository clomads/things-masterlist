## Description

I live in a small school bus that I'm converting and have been rebuilding some things with 1" aluminum square tube to keep weight down. This vertical tube next to my bed/sofa, where I spend most of my time, needed a finish cap and my water bottle needed a home that wasn't the floor. 

It is specifically designed to fit the **1" tube at 1/16" thickness**, but I've included the Fusion360 file for you to edit… I've used parameter variables for ID(imension) and OD of the square tube. There's an image above that shows that you can find these parameters in Modify>Change Parameters (2nd from bottom of menu).

**Print Notes**

I print everything with PETG these days because bus, but it should be fine in PLA, ABS or whatever. I made sure to align the STL for printing, but if it gets messed up, **align one of the profiles of the hook to the bed**, allowing the insert to point up at an angle and **enable supports.** Don't worry, there aren't many to deal with and easy to remove. My machine doesn't like doing supports on PETG and it was fine.
