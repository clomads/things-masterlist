## Description

This spring clip is designed specifically for FDM 3D printing with a 0.4mm nozzle. The clip is 0.8mm wide and should be printed on its side.

I use it to keep my glasses and a headset near my bed… might be good for glasses on a dashboard or something, let me know what you do with it.

Mount with double sided tape, VHB, or glue or whatever. Includes original F3D files to make your own edits.
